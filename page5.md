# Conclusion

From our research, we came to two major conclusions. One, the aggregate corpus of the newspaper articles on Ghana and Kenya reflects the #AfricaRising narrative on Twitter. There is a focus on economics and development in both. We cannot truly say whether the Africa Rising narrative is more centralized or more decentralized. The overlap between Twitter and the Factiva topic models indicates that it is a broader, decentralized narrative. However, the increased use of #AfricaRising after two World Bank Reports in spring 2014 shows that major institutions can influence the conversation on social media. So, our first question ultimately remains unanswered. Two, the Factiva corpus shows us that national narratives about investment in Ghana and Kenya generally reflect national interests. The newspapers from Africa are talking about African politics. The articles from most FDI source countries are talking about business. Then, FDI in certain industries is linked to greater coverage of those industries in the source country. This link is not uniform but it is clearly present. We canâ€™t say whether this narrative is driving investment or whether the investment is driving the narrative; however, our research indicates that the two are closely connected.
