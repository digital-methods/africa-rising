# Global Analysis

**Topic model:**

Using our corpus of newspaper articles, we generated a topic model for the whole corpus. This global topic model enables us to examine the discourses surrounding these two countries at an aggregate level. Our interpretation of the topic model revealed the dominant global narrative emphasized business and development in the two countries. Other major topics included Western political involvement, education, law and order, and violence and terrorism. This suggests that as regards these two countries, the world cares more about business opportunities there than they do any other variable. 

Two limitations in the global topic model constrain our ability to reach generalizable conclusions. One, we labeled the topics, so we need to be cautious of the biases that creates and attributing too much meaning to a given label. Two, due to Factiva’s subscription choices, we collected articles for some newspapers over a longer period than others. This decision could drowned out the narrative in newspapers collected over a shorter period than those collected over the full 20 year period. 


**Twitter Network Mapping and Demography:**

 With Twitter, the network map of the hashtags used in combination with #AfricaRising shows three things. One, it demonstrates that business and development is the backbone of the narrative. Two, it identifies the key countries associated with the narrative. We see, in particular, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria. This positioning underscores the logic behind selecting Kenya and Ghana for our Factiva analysis. Three, this network map also explains why we need the Factiva analysis. Here, we have a general overview of the terms used online; however, it is pretty superficial. 

Demography adds some additional context. The use of #AfricaRising jumped precipitously in weeks 120 (end of April 2013), 177 (early June 2014), 181 (early July 2014), and 343 (late July 2017). The World Bank’s April 2014 titled “Africa Rising” and press release on “Africa’s Strong Growth” likely triggered some of the online discussion of Africa Rising in late spring and summer 2014, the period when the hashtag was most frequently used. This overlap indicates that reports by major institutions can drive online conversation.
