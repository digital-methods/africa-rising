Semantic Network Analysis and Contingency Matrix 
here we need to add the factiva network mapping + contingency matrix
 
With our Factiva data, we created a semantic network map and a contingency matrix to see which newspapers discuss which industries. We used both tools because the semantic network revealed some trends not present on the contingency matrix and vice versa. We then compared our findings to the existing statistics and literature on FDI in Ghana and Kenya. These statistics were gathered from academic research and annual reports from sources such as IMF, the World Bank, and UNCTAD. From these sources, we found that countries like the UK, France, and South Africa provide the most FDI to Ghana and Kenya.

Ghana’s FDI figures, as seen in the chart above, often overlap with the network map. India is one of the largest sources of FDI for agriculture, and the Times of India is tagged next to the neon green agricultural cluster on the network map (bottom of the map). India is also a major investor in transport, storage, and communications. The Times of India then appears next to the communications cluster. China is also the largest investor in transport, storage, and communications. Xinhua News Agency is then tagged next to the purple transportation cluster. There, however, are some counterexamples to this trend. For example, the UK invests a substantial amount in construction but The Guardian is not tagged next to the construction cluster.

When we break down FDI into investments by particular companies and compare that FDI with the contingency matrix, we see an occasional link between FDI and the narrative in a given country’s newspaper. For the UK, we see red squares for media, business/consumer services, and food/beverages/tobacco. The number of observed co-occurrences in the Guardian for food/beverages/tobacco appear to be 500% greater than the expected number of co-occurrences in the Guardian. On the contrary, we see blue squares, indicating no correlation, for banking and financial services. Without FDI data on media, we cannot make a comparison for that industry. 

For France, companies like Umarco and CFAO invest heavily in transportation and trade. Then, the dark red square at the overlap between Agence France Presse and transportation/shipping indicates that the number of observed co-occurrences is roughly 1200% greater than the number of expected co-occurrences. 

In general, the discourse around Ghana often reflects the investments of the country where the newspaper is headquartered. Counterexamples exist, so we cannot speak of a strong correlation between FDI and discourse in newspapers.

Looking at Kenya, it is clear who is investing in Kenya but it is far less clear where these countries are investing their money. To compensate for this shortcoming in the data, we had to supplement our data with qualitative research. Through this research, we found that Australia invests a substantial amount in mineral extraction in Kenya. China invests a substantial amount in infrastructure and construction. India invests largely in Kenya’s pharmaceutical, medical, and agricultural sectors. 

When we look at the semantic network map, the Times of India is tagged next to a pharmaceutical cluster. The Australian is tagged next to a mining cluster. Xinhua, as previously mentioned, is tagged next to the transportation cluster. Therefore, we have a couple examples of the discourse in newspapers correlating with investments. The lack of precise FDI data by country and industry prevents a more comprehensive analysis.

We should also note a another limitation in this analysis. Due to technical issues with Cortext at the time of analysis, we could not separate articles on Ghana from those on Kenya. So, we were forced to compare country-level FDI data with a semantic network and contingency matrix for both countries. With these results and limitations, we can see a clear connection between a country’s industry-level investments in Ghana and Kenya and the narrative around Ghana and Kenya in a newspaper from the source country. We, however, cannot fully quantify this relationship and must acknowledge that the connection is far from uniform.
