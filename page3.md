CHINA VS INDIA - Topic Model

Given the outsized role of the US, China, and India in Africa, we would like to highlight the topic models for these three countries. The model for China reveals that “Middle East security issues” is the largest topic discussed concerning Ghana and Kenya. A bit of international relations knowledge would suggest that this topic primarily applies to Kenya. Al-Shabaab’s terrorist activities deeply concerns Chinese businessmen and diplomats. Following Middle East security issues is sports (despite removing sports articles), culture, development and investment, and diplomacy - in that order. China has alway been presumed to be relatively apolitical in Africa. This topic model seems to challenge this presumption. 

India, on the other hand, has maintained what seems a strictly business outlook on Ghana and Kenya. This is indicated by the fact that business and information and communications technology (ICT) is the most dominant topic, followed by agriculture and trade, investment analyses, culture, and development. 

NORTH AMERICA - Topic Model

The North American narrative of Kenya and Ghana defies expectations. Home and family appear to be the most dominant topic, followed by books and films, education, development, African politics, and investment and trade. The preeminence of arts topics could have been influenced by the selection of newspapers in this region. For example, the New York Times boasts a large arts and culture section. The relatively low-ranking position of investment and trade would suggest that North American, mostly US involvement, in Africa focus on development aid rather than business investment. Looking at data from the OECD, US net official development aid (ODA) in 2016 was USD 33.6 billion. In the same year, US investments made in Africa were valued at USD 57.47 billion, according to data from Statistica. So, although the raw figures do reveal that FDI investments outpace ODA, US ODA to Africa has been on the rise, increasing by 7% in 2016 according to the OECD. A Huffington Post article argues that US ODA has risen in response to China’s growing influence on the continent.
